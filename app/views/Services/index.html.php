            <h3>Why Horde Groupware?</h3>
            <p>Horde is the most flexible groupware on the planet, and that makes it
            the perfect platform on which to build your business productivity software:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Horde connects to (and officially supports) more backends (all
                the leading SQL, LDAP, IMAP, Sieve, SMTP, cache platforms available
                today)  than any other open source groupware system.  This means you
                can continue to use your existing userbase and your users do not
                have to remember any additional passwords.</li>
                <li>Data entered in Horde may be updated or consumed via a wide
                range of front-end protocols (HTTP/HTML, DAV, SyncML, ActiveSync,
                iCalendar, more).  Why let your data be siloed?  Horde presents your
                information where you need it.</li>
                <li>Template and CSS-based design makes customization easy.  There
                are nearly unlimited numbers of ways to customize and configure
                Horde to fit almost any need.</li>
                <li>Maturity. Horde's source code goes back over 10 years and
                benefits from years of engineering, bugfixes, security reports
                testing and user feedback.</li>
                <li>Feature-rich. Horde's feature set rivals the largest enterprise
                email systems.  We have an incredible feature set that compares
                favorably against any competition in our primary apps (mail,
                calendar, address book), and even more in our secondary apps
                (time tracking, wiki, ticketing, and more).</li>
                <li>Open Source. Horde is open source, which means there are never
                per-user licensing fees or costly mandatory support contracts.
                It also means that, if necessary, you can customize any part
                of Horde at any time.</li>
                <li>Active development. Horde benefits from a large and active
                community of developers and users, and continues to add features
                nearly every day.</li>
            </ul>
