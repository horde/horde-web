<h1>1. Introduction
</h1>
<P>Thanks to several new web mail products (like IMP), web designers have
been able to offer web based email with their web systems.  However, as
web mail solutions using these products have become more popular, the
scalability issue has come to the forefront. Most web mail systems (and
certainly the free ones) are designed around single mail server, single
web server operation, with all the limitations that a single machine
brings to the fold.  Scaling beyond a few thousand users was simply not
easily feasible, which is why I set out to devise a simple system that
has virtually unlimited scalability.</p>

<h3>1.1  Background
</h3>
<P>Web based email is taking off like wildfire, and with such sites as
hotmail and bigfoot becoming so popular, other sites are looking to add
web based email to their repertiore of services.  As such, products like
EmuMail and IMP have come over the horizon to help people offer this
service to their patrons.  However, web mail sites based upon these new
products are also becoming quite popular and are taxing the network and
machine resources.  Without a custom solution, like hotmail's, popular
webmail systems using off-the-shelf webmail systems are starting to feel
growing pains.  As such, it's becoming necessary to find an webmail
solution that both relatively easy to implement and scalable to
thousands or even millions of users.</p>

<P>In my case, I work as a developer for <A href="http://www.dn.net">DigitalNation</a>,
working on the <a href="http://www.wcities.com">Worldcities</a> project. 
<a href="http://www.wcities.com">Worldcities</a> is a globally local news and information site that also
offers web based email.  Webmail is highly popular outside of the US
since many non-US ISPs do not offer their customer mail services, and
since <a href="http://www.wcities.com">Worldcities</a> is not US centric, we've quickly realized that
scalability is very necessary.</p>

<P>Our previous set up used dual servers, one running <a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a>,
and the other running <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a>, an open source webmail
system built in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> (and the best, I might add).  The system was very
easy to implement, and served its job well.  However, after only a
couple of months it became very apparent that our system was straining
under the pressure, and we needed to find a new solution quickly.  Also,
since we had so many active users, we could not abandon their already
existing mail.</p>

<P>Previously we had chosed <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> because of it's free status (i.e. I can
make changes to it as necessary) and <a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a> because they
were the standard tools.  It was obvious that <a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a> was
too slow for our uses, so I researched other MTAs and IMAP servers.  </p>


<p>I ultimately decided on <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> as the MTA,
since it's at minimum 3 times faster than <a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail</a>, and 
<A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">cyrus</a> since it neither requires user
accounts on the host machine nor uses the system resources that <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a>
does. We also kept <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> because of its free status, because of its easy
configuration, and because we didn't want to subject users to a new
interface.  Also, in the course of research, I discovered that <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a>
can use an <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> server for its alias database
(using the maildrop attribute and mailacceptinggeneralid attribute) and
that there was a patch for <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</a> that allowed <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</a> to use an <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a>
server for authentication.  Combine that with a DNS round robin for the
frontend web/incoming mail server(s), and you have the ingredients for a
highly scalable web mail solution.  It just became a matter of putting
it all together.</p>

<p>It turned out that the mix was rather easy too.  The bulk of the
scalability comes from <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a>'s ability to forward mail to another user
or machine based upon the maildrop attribute of an <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> server.  All
that needed to be done is to use a full email address for the maildrop
attribute, which pointed to the machine that the user's mail was
actually hosted on.  For instance, if the DNS MX record points to the
frontend mailserver of mail.dom.ain, and <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> says to maildrop 
user@dom.ain to user@machine44.dom.ain, then <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> running on the
front end mail server will forward mail for that user to machine44. 
With feature alone, you can have unlimited mail accounts in your
domain.  All you have to do is keep adding boxes to the back end.</p>

<p>The tricky part, or so I thought, was to get the mail off the backend
server and into <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a>.  Since <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> already supports mail servers separate
from the web server, what needed to be done is to retrieve the mail
server machine name from <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a>, instead of relying on the configuration
setting and a single mail server.  It turned out that setting the mail
server was extremely easy, requiring only a few lines of new code in one
file, and adding new configuration parameters to <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a>s default
configuration file.  We had <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> forwarding and <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> retrieving mail
from multiple machines.  I could have left it at that.</p>

<p>However, <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a> was still an issue.  For a multiple of reasons, it was
too slow for our uses:  it used a flat file format, which is not
scalable to large numbers of mail messages, it used the host machine's
authentication system, which required accounts on the machine and had to
parse /etc/passwd every time someone logged on, and it was just plain
slower than we wanted.  So we decided to use <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</A>, which has none of
these limitations, as our imap server.  Best of all, with Clayton
Donely's <a href="http://www.linc-dev.com">LDAP patch for Cyrus</a>, we could use
the same <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> server as <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> for authentication.  This made our
entire mail system portable in addition to scalable, and we didn't have
to keep multiple copies of passwords.  After all this is what <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> was
designed for.</p>

<p>So finally, what we have is a frontend farm of web/mail servers in DNS
round robin, forwarding mail and retrieving mail based upon an <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a>
server to the proper backend mailserver which also uses <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> for
authentication.  Since <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> servers are replicable, there is no single
machine in the system (provided the machine have highspeed
interconnectivity) that can either be a point of failure or slow the
system down.  This is the holy grail of scalability, and with the help
of open source tools, what we designed.</p>

<h3>1.2  Assumptions
</h3>
This document refers to three servers: the web server, the imap server,
and the <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> server.  These servers can be separate machines, several
separate machines (i.e. 23 web servers, 5 <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> servers, and 10 imap
servers), or a single machine.  It also assumes basic knowledge of
installing software from source in a UNIX or Linux environment.

<h3>1.3  What is used.
</h3>
<P>The following software packages are used with this document.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache 1.3.6</a>
<li>  <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> 3.0.12 with IMAP and <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> compiled in.
<li> <a href="http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a> 1.2
<li>  <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</A> 1.5.19 (note: do not use the 1.6 tree)
<li>  <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> 19990627
<li>   <a href="http://www.linc-dev.com">pwcheck_ldap patch</a> for cyrus 1.5 series
<li>   <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> (2.0.4, 2.0.10, and 2.1.3-dev tested)
<li>  <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a> (for the c-client)
</ul>

<p>note: the cyrus 1.6 tree uses a different method of authentication,
called SASL, and the pwcheck_ldap patch is not designed for it. 
However, I'm told that an LDAP patch for SASL is in the works, so when
that happens, this point will be moot.</p>

<h3>1.4  Of Special Note
</h3>
<P>The setup described in this document does have one point that is not yet scalable, the SQL server used by IMP to store session data, preferences and the address book.  The author is currently working on a mechanism by which the SQL server can also be easily scaled.</p>


<h1>2. Installing Software
</h1>
<h3>2.1 The Web Server
</h3>
<P>On the web server, you will need to install Apache, <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a>,
<a href="http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">UW IMAP</a>, and <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a>.</P>

<P>Installing Apache and <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> is straight forward and is covered by the <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>
install docs.  You will need to compile in <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> and IMAP support in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>.</p>

<P>Install <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> according to the accompanying docs, particularly the
LDAP_README.</p>

<h3>2.2 The LDAP Server
</h3>
<P>On the ldap server, you will need to install <a href="http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a>.  You will also
need to decide on a root dn and add that to the <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> db accordingly.</P>

<h3>2.3 The IMAP server
</h3>
<P>On the IMAP server, you will need to install <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a>, <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a>, <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</a>, and
the pwcheck_ldap patch for cyrus.  Install <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> with ldap support
according to the docs.  Install <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</a> according to the docs, but adding
pwcheck_ldap.c according to the pwcheck_ldap docs. Don't forget that you
need to modify the pwcheck_ldap.c file to reflect your ldap server and
base dn.  Also, you may need to add the line </P> <pre>

#include &lt;linux/stddef.h>
</pre>
<P>to pwcheck_ldap.c if you run linux as your imap server and you may need
to make a few syntax corrections in the file (I forget where they are
right now) to get pwcheck to compile properly. Configure cyrus with the
command</p><Pre>

./configure --with-login=unix_pwcheck --with-pwcheck=ldap
</pre>
<P>since the pwcheck_ldap docs omit the --with-login directive. Compile,
install according to the cyrus docs.</P>

<h1>3. Configuring the servers to work together
</h1>
<h3>3.1  The LDAP Server
</h3>
<P>Each mail user's entry in the LDAP database needs to have the following
entries, in addition to any other entries you choose to use (assuming
your basedn is o=someorg, c=US):</P><pre>

dn: uid=someuser, o=someorg, c=us
uid: someuser
userpassword: somepassword
maildrop: fulladdress@machine.dom.ain
mailacceptinggeneralid: someuser
</pre>(and for an added benefit, if you like)<pre>
mailacceptinggeneralid: somealias
</pre>
<P>Also, you will need to choose a user which will have cyrus admin
rights.  You don't need to worry about this until you configure cyrus on
the imap server, but keep it in mind. Also, don't choose an existing user for admin privs, problems may include a security hole and/or inability to check mail for that user.</p>

<h3>3.2 the imap server
</h3>
<P>configure <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> on the imap server to use ldap for its alias mapping. 
This is explained in LDAP_README in the <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> docs.  For <A Href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus</a>, follow
the install directions that come with the package.  Also, don't forget
to activate pwcheck and to add your admin user to imapd.conf.</p>

<h3>3.3 the web server
</h3>
<P>in this setup, the web server(s) is also the front end incoming mail
gateway.  Configure <a href="http://www.postfix.org">postfix</a> to use ldap for it's alias_map.  What it
does is check for the maildrop <a href="http://www.openldap.org">LDAP</a> entry and forwards the mail to the
maildrop address, hence the need for the full machine name in the
maildrop attribute.  </p>

<P>For instance, you could have 700,000 users split among servers 10000 a
piece.  Mail that comes into one of the web server(s) addressed to
user1@dom.ain will forward to the maildrop address of
user1@mail05@dom.ain while mail addressed to user657 would forward to
user657@mail34.  In addition, the maildrop attribute could be used as a
forwarding address i.e. user302 forwards to someuser@somewhereelse.com.</p>

<P>Configure imp as you normally would according to the docs.  After you're
configured make the following changes:</P>

<p>to config/defaults.php3 add the following lines:</P><pre>

/* LDAP/IMAP Server Default */
$default->LDAP_server               = 'ldap.dom.ain';
$default->LDAP_dn                   = 'o=someorg,c=US';
$default->LDAP_search_field         = 'uid';
$default->ldap_choose_server        = true;
</pre>
to mailbox.php3 apply the following patch: 
<pre>
Index: mailbox.php3
===================================================================
RCS file: /home/cvs/imp/mailbox.php3,v

+     $ldapbind = ldap_bind($ldapconnect);
+     $ldapsearch = ldap_search($ldapconnect, $default->LDAP_dn, $default->LDAP_search_field."=".$imapuser, array("maildrop"));
+     $ldapget = ldap_get_entries($ldapconnect, $ldapsearch);
+     $ldapspl = explode("@", $ldapget[0]["maildrop"][0]);
+     $server = $ldapspl[1];
+     $port = $default->port;
+   }
+ }
+ /**********end ldap************/
+ 
+ 
  /* Html styles configuration */
  require './config/html.php3';
  /* Mailbox configuration */
</pre>
and you're done. Now you have a highly scalable web mail solution.</p>

<P>note: as of August 5, 1999, the development version of <A href="http://horde.org">IMP</a> contains
these patches, and therefore do not need to be added.</P>

<h1>4. Miscellaneous
</h1>
<h3>4.1  Adding Users
</h3>
<P>here's a code snippet that will add a user to the LDAP server and add a
mailbox to cyrus.  It is designed for one imap server, but can easily be
altered to search for a server based on whatever criteria you choose.</P>
<pre>
&lt;?php
$ldapconn = ldap_connect("ldap.dom.ain");
$machine = "mail01";
if ($ldapconn) {
  $ldhb = ldap_bind($ldapconn, "cn=cyrusadmin, o=someorg,c=US","password");
  $dn = "uid=". $username .", o=someorg, c=US";
  $info["uid"]=$username;
  $info["userpassword"] = $password;
  $info["objectclass"] = "account";
  $info["maildrop"] = $username ."@" .$machine .".dom.ain";
  $info["mailacceptinggeneralid"] = $username;
  $ldhb = ldap_add($ldapconn, $dn, $info);
  ldap_close($ldapconn);
}

$imapconn = imap_open("{" .$machine .".dom.ain:143}", "cyrusadmin","password");
if ($imapopen) {   
   imap_createmailbox($imapconn, "{" .$machine ."dom.ain:143}user.".$username );
   imap_close($imapconn);
} 
?></pre>

<P>note: due to a bug which I have yet to track down, encrypted passwords
cannot be reliably supported, use plaintext passwords instead.</P>
